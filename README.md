# Hi, my name is Maxwell Johnson. I am 17 in 11th grade in the Digital Game Development program at Southwest Career and Technical Academy
# Coming into Southwest Career and Technical Academy in my freshman year, I believed that making games would be as fun as they would be to play them, and although I was proven wrong, it has been a good learning experience
# Currently we are working on a new project as a Summative and most likely will be worked on further into Quarter 4
